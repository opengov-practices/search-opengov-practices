The European Commission has initially created a Task Force consisting of representatives, from all Member States, responsible for the Architecture design and the service implementation of the National Spatial Data Infrastructures and to help and support the implementation of INSPIRE in the Member States. The INSPIRE directive has led to a series of implementing rules (regulations) and technical guidelines. In 2013, a Commission expert group was set up called INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Group (MIG) with representatives of the INSPIRE national contact points. The INSPIRE Maintenance and Implementation Group (MIG) consists of a wide group of stakeholders and is divided into many sub-groups, collaborating actively on many topics related to the maintenance and implementation of INSPIRE.

Electronic Public Records (OEP) is a collaborative tool which central government agencies use to publicize their public records online. Public record data are stored in one searchable database. Users can search this database to locate case documents relevant to their field of interest. Having located relevant case documents, users may submit requests to view these. Requests are sent to the respective agencies responsible for the case documents and public record entries. The agencies themselves then process requests sent to them via OEP, and reply to users directly.\nOEP was launched on 18 May 2010 and, by August 2013, by far the the greatest number of government offices and agencies, altogether 114 different entities, exported their electronic records to OEP on a daily or weekly basis. There are nearly 8 million document titles in OEP and more than 550000 demands for access to documents, nearly 17000 per month. A user survey indicates that 61% of the demands were based on professional reasons, 28% on private reasons and 7% were demands from different civil society groups. 50% of the demands were from journalists, 22% from the private sector, 17% from the public sector and 3% from researchers and scientific staff.","Link":"https://www.oep.no/","Stakeholder":"Norwegian Government","Comments":[],"StakeholderType":"National_Authority","Theme":"Government_and_public_sector","Object":"Public_policy","GovernmentPower":"Executive","Users":"Citizen","GovernmentRole":"Lead"}
